# Marker Animator for Mapbox in Flutter

This package allows smooth animation of markers on a Mapbox map by adding and moving markers dynamically based on the live locations of markers.

## Features

- Add marker(s) dynamically to the map.
- Animate marker markers from one location to another with smooth transitions.
- Supports both position and rotation animation curves.
- Customize marker properties such as size, opacity, and rotation.
- Easily remove marker markers from the map.

### Note
This package only animate the marker's changes. Mapbox configuration is out of the scope of this package. So, before trying this package to ensure that you have properly configured your Mapbox map and have a basic understanding of how to add markers to the map.


## Installation

To use this package, add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_mapbox_animarker: ^0.0.9
  <your_other_dependencies>
```

### 1. Add a Marker(s):

You can add a marker(s) and pass the marker's movement data as follows:

```dart
final markerAnimator = MarkerAnimator(mapboxMap);
markerAnimator.addMarkerPoint(
  'markerId123',
  'assets/marker_icon.png',  // Path to your marker image
  [
    {'position': [longitude, latitude], 'rotation': 0},
    {'position': [longitude2, latitude2], 'rotation': 30},
    // Add more positions as needed
  ],
  interval: 0.05,  // Optional: interval between animation frames
  properties: {
    "icon-opacity": 0.9,
    "icon-size": 1.2,
  }
);
```

### 2. Remove a Marker Marker:

To remove a marker marker from the map:

```dart
await markerAnimator.removeMarker();
```

### 3. Customize Marker Properties:

You can pass custom properties for the marker:

```dart
Map<String, dynamic> customProperties = {
  "icon-opacity": 0.8,
  "icon-size": 1.5,
  "icon-anchor": "center",
  'icon-allow-overlap': true,
};

markerAnimator.addMarkerPoint(
  'markerId456',
  'assets/another_marker_icon.png',
  data,  // The marker movement data
  properties: customProperties,
);
```

### 4. Marker Style Properties

The properties should follow the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/#type) for symbol layers. These properties allow you to control aspects like icon size, opacity, rotation, anchor position, and more.

## Notes

- The marker movement data should include a list of positions and rotations.
- The animation interval controls the speed of the marker transition. A smaller interval results in smoother animations.
- Ensure you handle the Mapbox API key and map initialization properly.
